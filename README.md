# blinkr
Engine that powers [Blink](http://justblink.xyz)

## Introduction

Event based, single node system that can power a simple web site. It is fast and light weight. 
Currently it is only designed to host [Blink](http://justblink.xyz). But you can easily change 
it to host your own site.

##Frontend Development
Blinkr has compiled source files for both [Blink Client](https://github.com/kasun90/blink-app) 
and [Blink Admin](https://github.com/kasun90/blink-admin-app) in this repository. Do your own modifications
using following repositories.

* [Blink Client](https://github.com/kasun90/blink-app) in ReactJS
* [Blink Admin](https://github.com/kasun90/blink-admin-app) in Angular 6
